# google_compute_load_balancing

### Sentinel file "google_compute_load_balancing.sentinel" is having code to deploy the policies. In order to check the value of Load balancer should be INTERNAL_MANAGED , We need to validate policy successfully.**
* the purpose of this policy is to validate the value of the load_balancing_scheme.
### Variables :
* messages: It is being used to hold the complete message of policies violation to show to the user.

* control statements: here we are looping and assigning the all the resourses into two parameters

    * Parameters
      |Name|Description|
      |----|-----|
      |address|The key inside of resource_changes section for particular GCP Resource in tfplan mock|
      |rc|The value of address key inside of resource_changes section for particular GCP Resource in tfplan mock|
* condition: here the if condition is comparing the value of load_balancing_scheme is not INTERNAL_MANAGED  it will generate appropriate message to show the users.

#### Terraform version
